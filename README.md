## Simple Defi
---

This is a dapp for yeild farming. 

It involves 2 ERC20 tokens:
- DAI Token (DAI)
- My Token (MAI)

---

MAI is out token farm specific token that the investors can earn by staking their DAI.

During the time of token distribution, the investors earn the tokens that they staked in our dApp.

The investors can invest a certain number of DAI Tokens, and unstake specific number of DAI tokens at any point of time.

The script for MAI token issuance can be run by the owner only. At specific times, the owner runs the script, and all the stakers get the same amount of MAI as the number of DAI staked.
